# qwirkler
Greedy solver for the Qwirkle board game, written in Rust.

This project is adapted from [Scala version][1] and was used to teach myself Rust.

This version has been optimised for performance at the cost of readability.

`cargo bench` shows that it can play a full game of Qwirkle against itself in around 11ms.
